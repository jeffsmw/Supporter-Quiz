Assumptions made in this quiz:

* Validation only checks if there is something in the fields.
EX: The email field does not need @ sign

* Only the pagination during "Search" will result in a Search page. Clicking on edit, delete, and done/undone will result in the requests page.

* Too lazy to put the search back in the search field, so I just stuck it in a paragraph tag.
